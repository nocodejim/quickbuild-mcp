# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QuickBuild MCP Server is a standardized, secure bridge that enables AI agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with QuickBuild v14 CI/CD systems through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This server eliminates the need for custom-built, single-purpose clients by providing a reusable, standards-compliant interface that translates MCP requests into QuickBuild REST API calls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI agent developer, I want to connect my MCP client to a QuickBuild instance, so that I can programmatically interact with CI/CD workflows without building custom integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client connects to the server THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully with the QuickBuild v14 REST API
2. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL expose available tools and resources according to MCP specification
3. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages without exposing credentials

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to view all available build configurations, so that I can understand what builds are available for automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request the configurations resource THEN the system SHALL return a list of all build configurations from QuickBuild
2. WHEN configurations are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include configuration ID, name, and hierarchy information
3. IF the QuickBuild API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to trigger builds for specific configurations, so that I can automate CI/CD workflows based on events or conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the builds.trigger tool with a valid configuration ID THEN the system SHALL initiate a new build in QuickBuild
2. WHEN triggering a build with variables THEN the system SHALL pass those variables to the QuickBuild API
3. WHEN a build is successfully triggered THEN the system SHALL return the build ID and initial status
4. IF the configuration ID is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an error without attempting to trigger

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to check the status of the latest build for a configuration, so that I can monitor build progress and outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call builds.get_latest_status with a configuration ID THEN the system SHALL return the most recent build's status and version
2. WHEN retrieving build status THEN the system SHALL include build state, completion time, and success/failure information
3. IF no builds exist for the configuration THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate message indicating no builds found

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to view the status of all build agents, so that I can understand grid capacity and agent availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call grid.list_agents THEN the system SHALL return all build agents and their connection status
2. WHEN listing agents THEN the system SHALL include agent name, status, and last contact time
3. WHEN agents are offline THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate their unavailable status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to access SCM changes for specific builds, so that I can understand what code changes triggered or are included in a build.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request changes for a build ID THEN the system SHALL return the list of SCM changes associated with that build
2. WHEN retrieving changes THEN the system SHALL include commit information, author, and change descriptions
3. IF the build ID is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an error message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to run in a Docker container, so that I can deploy it without contaminating the host system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the server THEN the system SHALL run entirely within a Docker container
2. WHEN configuring the server THEN the system SHALL accept QuickBuild credentials via environment variables
3. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL be accessible on the configured port (14002)
4. IF credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start with clear error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the server to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently, so that multiple AI agents can use the service simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple MCP clients connect simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle requests without significant delays
2. WHEN making API calls to QuickBuild THEN the system SHALL use efficient endpoints rather than fetching large datasets
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain stateless operation where possible

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to initiate database backups through the MCP server, so that I can automate backup procedures via AI agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call system.backup_database THEN the system SHALL initiate a server-side backup of the QuickBuild database
2. WHEN backup is initiated THEN the system SHALL return confirmation and backup job status
3. IF backup fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor server health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return user-friendly error messages to MCP clients
3. WHEN the server operates THEN the system SHALL log key operations for monitoring and debugging
