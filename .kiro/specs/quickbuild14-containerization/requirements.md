# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a production-ready, multi-tiered containerized deployment of QuickBuild 14 with Microsoft SQL Server as the database backend. The solution will provide complete Docker infrastructure, proper security configurations, and comprehensive documentation to enable organizations to deploy and manage QuickBuild 14 in containerized environments.

The system will support scalable build agents, persistent data storage, and follow enterprise security best practices while maintaining compatibility with existing QuickBuild installations and migration paths.

4. WHEN the server runs THEN the system SHALL persist configuration, logs, and artifacts using consolidated volume mounting
5. WHEN the server container starts THEN the system SHALL run as non-root user `quickbuild` (UID 1000) for security
6. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL dynamically configure database connection using environment variables
7. WHEN the server health check runs THEN the system SHALL verify the web interface is accessible and responsive
8. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL create symlinks for configuration directories to maintain expected file locations

### Requirement 3: Build Agent Containers

**User Story:** As a build administrator, I want scalable containerized build agents with different toolchains, so that I can execute builds for various technologies without maintaining separate build machines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the base agent container starts THEN the system SHALL use JDK 8 and QuickBuild 14 agent distribution
2. WHEN an agent starts THEN the system SHALL automatically register with the QuickBuild server using service discovery
3. WHEN agents run THEN the system SHALL provide specialized images for Maven, Node.js, and .NET development
4. WHEN an agent container starts THEN the system SHALL run as non-root user `qbagent` (UID 1001)
5. WHEN agents start THEN the system SHALL expose port 8811 for bi-directional communication with the server
6. WHEN agents initialize THEN the system SHALL auto-detect container IP and configure node.properties accordingly
7. WHEN multiple agents run THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling through Docker Compose or Kubernetes
8. WHEN agents connect THEN the system SHALL maintain persistent connection to the QuickBuild server

### Requirement 4: Container Orchestration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests for the entire QuickBuild stack, so that I can deploy the system in different environments from development to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Docker Compose THEN the system SHALL define a dedicated bridge network `qb-net` for service communication
2. WHEN containers start THEN the system SHALL ensure proper startup order (database → server → agents)
3. WHEN using Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL provide StatefulSets for database and server components
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL define appropriate resource limits and requests for each service
5. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL use DNS-based service discovery within the container network
6. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support adding/removing build agents without affecting running builds
7. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL provide health checks for all services to ensure proper startup
8. WHEN using persistent storage THEN the system SHALL define appropriate volume claims for data persistence

### Requirement 5: Security Configuration

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the containerized QuickBuild deployment to follow security best practices, so that the system is protected against common vulnerabilities and meets enterprise security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers run THEN the system SHALL execute all processes as non-root users with specific UIDs
2. WHEN handling secrets THEN the system SHALL use Docker secrets or Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
3. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL scan for vulnerabilities using security scanning tools
4. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL isolate database access to only QuickBuild server
5. WHEN exposing services THEN the system SHALL only expose necessary ports externally (QB server port 8810)
6. WHEN storing configurations THEN the system SHALL set proper file permissions (755 for scripts, 644 for configs)
7. WHEN connecting to database THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections with proper certificate handling
8. WHEN managing passwords THEN the system SHALL enforce strong password requirements for database authentication

### Requirement 6: Data Persistence and Backup

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data persistence and backup capabilities, so that I can protect build history, configurations, and artifacts from data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN the system SHALL persist QuickBuild data (configs, logs, artifacts) in dedicated volumes
2. WHEN the system runs THEN the system SHALL persist database data and transaction logs in separate volumes
3. WHEN performing backups THEN the system SHALL provide scripts for backing up both application and database data
4. WHEN restoring data THEN the system SHALL provide procedures for restoring from backup files
5. WHEN migrating THEN the system SHALL support migration from existing QuickBuild installations
6. WHEN containers restart THEN the system SHALL maintain all persistent data without loss
7. WHEN backing up THEN the system SHALL create timestamped backup files for version control
8. WHEN validating backups THEN the system SHALL provide verification procedures to ensure backup integrity
