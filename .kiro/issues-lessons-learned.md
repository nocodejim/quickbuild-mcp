# Issues and Lessons Learned - QuickBuild 14 Containerization

## Project Start: 2025-10-05

This document tracks errors, challenges, decisions, and insights discovered during the QuickBuild 14 containerization implementation.

## Implementation Log

### Task 1: Project Structure Setup (Completed)
**Started:** 2025-10-05
**Completed:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Decisions Made:**
- Using environment/docs folder for comprehensive project documentation
- Created manual JIRA tracking due to Service Desk project limitations
- Following the detailed specification from environment/kiro-qb14-spec.md
- Structured project with clear separation of concerns (server, database, agents)

**Completed Items:**
- ✅ Created complete directory structure
- ✅ Generated comprehensive .env.example with all required variables
- ✅ Updated .gitignore with Docker and project-specific exclusions
- ✅ Created main README.md with project overview
- ✅ Established documentation structure in environment/docs/
- ✅ Set up placeholder files for all major components

**Challenges Encountered:**
- JIRA MCP integration failed - QuickBuild-MCP appears to be a Service Desk project with different permissions
- Resolved by creating manual tracking system in environment/docs/jira-tracking.md

**Next Steps:**
- ✅ Completed Task 2: Microsoft SQL Server database container implementation
- ✅ Completed Task 3: QuickBuild server container implementation

### Task 2: Microsoft SQL Server Database Container (Completed)
**Started:** 2025-10-05
**Completed:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Decisions Made:**
- Used official Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Linux image for reliability
- Implemented custom entrypoint script for automated initialization
- Created comprehensive health checks with retry logic
- Used volume-based persistence for data and transaction logs

**Completed Items:**
- ✅ Database Dockerfile with proper security configuration
- ✅ Three-phase initialization scripts (database, user, permissions)
- ✅ Health check script with sqlcmd connectivity testing
- ✅ Custom entrypoint with first-run detection
- ✅ Volume mounts for data persistence

**Challenges Encountered:**
- SQL Server requires ACCEPT_EULA=Y environment variable
- Password complexity requirements for SA and qb_user accounts
- Proper timing for initialization scripts after SQL Server startup

**Technical Insights:**
- SQL Server startup takes 30-60 seconds in container environment
- Health checks need retry logic due to startup timing
- Custom entrypoint provides better control than default MSSQL initialization

### Task 3: QuickBuild Server Container (Completed)
**Started:** 2025-10-05
**Completed:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Decisions Made:**
- Used Eclipse Temurin JDK 8 (required for QuickBuild 14 compatibility)
- Implemented consolidated data volume approach for simplified backup/restore
- Downloaded Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver during build
- Created dynamic configuration system using environment variables

**Completed Items:**
- ✅ Server Dockerfile with JDK 8 and QuickBuild 14.0.11
- ✅ Hibernate configuration template for MSSQL connectivity
- ✅ Java Wrapper configuration template for containerized deployment
- ✅ Comprehensive entrypoint script with data volume management
- ✅ Health check script for server monitoring

**Challenges Encountered:**
- QuickBuild download URL structure required specific version handling
- JDBC driver integration needed proper classpath configuration
- Data volume symlink approach required careful permission management

**Technical Insights:**
- QuickBuild 14 requires JDK 8 specifically (not newer versions)
- Consolidated data volume approach simplifies backup/restore operations
- Environment variable substitution works well for dynamic configuration
- Health checks should test both HTTP connectivity and REST API availability

**Next Steps:**
- ✅ Completed Task 4: Build agent containers implementation
- ✅ Completed Task 5: Docker Compose orchestration implementation

### Task 4: Build Agent Containers (Completed)
**Started:** 2025-10-05
**Completed:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Decisions Made:**
- Used layered Docker approach with base agent + specialized toolchains
- Implemented auto-discovery of container IP for agent registration
- Pre-installed common tools and packages to speed up builds
- Created toolchain-specific entrypoint scripts for environment setup

**Completed Items:**
- ✅ Base agent Dockerfile with QuickBuild 14 agent distribution
- ✅ Agent entrypoint script with server discovery and registration
- ✅ Maven agent with Apache Maven 3.8.8 and optimized settings
- ✅ Node.js agent with NVM, Node 16.20.2, and common packages
- ✅ .NET agent with SDK 6.0 and global tools

**Challenges Encountered:**
- QuickBuild agent download structure required extracting from server package
- Container IP auto-detection needed multiple fallback methods
- Toolchain installations required careful dependency management
- Agent registration timing required server availability checks

**Technical Insights:**
- Layered approach enables efficient image reuse and maintenance
- Pre-warming toolchains (Maven, npm, NuGet) significantly improves build times
- Agent naming strategy important for identification in QuickBuild UI
- Health checks should verify both process and server connectivity

### Task 5: Docker Compose Orchestration (Completed)
**Started:** 2025-10-05
**Completed:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Decisions Made:**
- Created environment-specific override files for flexibility
- Implemented Docker secrets for production security
- Used named volumes for data persistence and caching
- Created scaling management scripts for operational ease

**Completed Items:**
- ✅ Main Docker Compose configuration with all services
- ✅ Production override with secrets and resource limits
- ✅ Development override with debugging and local mounts
- ✅ Scaling configuration with replica management
- ✅ Cross-platform scaling scripts (Bash + PowerShell)
- ✅ Secrets management documentation and structure

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Service dependency management required proper health check integration
- Volume configuration needed different approaches for dev vs prod
- Scaling scripts required cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux)
- Resource limits needed balancing between performance and system resources

**Technical Insights:**
- Docker Compose override files provide excellent environment flexibility
- Named volumes with caching significantly improve build performance
- Health check dependencies ensure proper startup sequencing
- Scaling automation requires integration with build queue metrics
- Secrets management critical for production deployments

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Task 6: Kubernetes manifests implementation

## Decision Log

### Architecture Decisions
- **Database Choice:** Microsoft SQL Server 2022 (Linux) - Required by specification
- **Base Images:** eclipse-temurin:8-jdk-focal for Java components - JDK 8 required for QB14
- **Network Strategy:** Dedicated bridge network (qb-net) for service isolation and discovery

### Security Decisions
- **User Strategy:** Non-root users for all containers (quickbuild UID 1000, qbagent UID 1001)
- **Secrets Management:** Docker secrets/K8s secrets for sensitive data
- **Network Isolation:** Database not exposed externally, only QB server port 8810 public
